<p>
An end user can submit a ticket through various communication channels such as email, web form, or phone. Then the ticket is created in the system and it is categorized based on the predefined criteria (department, help topic, prioritym etc). For this example I went and created a ticket through a web form and selected the best help topic that is appropriate for the problem.

<p>
The ticket is then assigned to an agent or a team. It can be done automatically or by a supervisor. The ticket's priority and due date may be set at this stage. Then the assigned agent or team reviews the ticket and responds to the end user or customer, seeking additional information if necessary or providing a solution. This is basically what I did at this stage. I assigned the ticket to an agent that I craeted and communicated with them to find a solution.

<p>
Working the issue is the next step. This is where an agent works on diagnosing the problem by performing tests, gathering data or consulting internal knowledge bases such as talking to other agents. The picture above is an example of me asking another agent for help and that agent seems to have found the problem. Once the root cause was identified, I implemented a solution and provided a temporary workound.

</p>
<p>
The resolution is the final step. Yet again once I found the solution, I applied the fix. I updated the ticket status to "resolved". This indicates that the problem has been adressed. Then after some time, the ticket is then marked as closed.
